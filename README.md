WHAT IS THIS ?
==============

this is a testprogram for communication with arduino mega over telnet.
for example :
  different commands can be sent and reply received .. an so on ..

it includes some kind of "multitasking" .. with timer interrupt and a fsm structure

.. hope it works in the future .. bu a part exists

===================
1. my bad english
2. it is my first project in git.

WHY MEGA ?
==========
.. because it has a lotof inputs and outputs and more memory than uno or nano
